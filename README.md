# Machine Learning-based Prediction and Uncertainty Assessment of Future EU Allowance Price  

Carbon emission allowance prices have a significant impact on the decision-making of governments establishing carbon reduction policies and companies pursuing carbon reduction projects, making the prediction of carbon emission allowance prices essential for the economic and feasibility analysis of domestic and international carbon reduction projects.

Although the price of carbon emission allowances in Europe has been undergoing rapid changes over the past three years, previous research has been limited to univariate predictions that only consider the price of oil (Kim and An, 2016).

This study confirms, through correlation analysis, that the prices of energy over the past 12 years (including coal, oil, natural gas, and electricity prices in Europe), market size, exchange rates, interest rates, and GDP—a total of eight economic indicators—have a significant impact on the prices of carbon emission allowances.

It proposes a machine learning-based multivariate prediction model for the future prices of carbon emission allowances, utilizing these eight factors.
